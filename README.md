# Space Inflators

This game was originally made for the GMTK Game Jam 2024 under 96 hours. This is the first time I ever participated in a game jam. Despite the game's scope being small, It was still very stressful to make on a time limit, but I managed to make the game adhere to (most of) my vision in the end. I learned a lot from this experience and I'm very happy I participated in the jam!
